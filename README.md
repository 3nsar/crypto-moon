# CRYPTO-COIN-MARKET CREATED WITH REACT JS AND FIREBASE V9

With the Crypto-Moon app, you are able to see the latest updates in the crypto market. This is possible, thanks to multiple APIs. You can also sort them in many categories. This app also contains a chat room where you can chat with people around the world. I mainly used React, Firebase v9, and Material UI.
